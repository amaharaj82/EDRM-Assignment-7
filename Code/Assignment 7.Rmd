1. Create a a function that accepts (1) a quantitative response variable, (2) a quantitative explanatory variable, and (3) a number. Suppose we denote the response variable as y, the explanatory variable as x, and the number as p. Your function should model y as a linear function of x and then for each (x,y) pair determine if hte residual is one of the p largest in the set of residuals, with largest defined in terms of absolute value (e.g., a residual of -10 is just as large as a residual of 10). The function should return a logical vector indicating TRUE for each pair that has one of the pth largest residuals and FALSE otherwise. 

```{r}

```

2. Obtain a real data set with quantitative response and explanatory variales (n>=50). Plot these scatterplot with a regression line. Use your function to help you highlight the 10% largest residuals on the scatterplot. 



This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
